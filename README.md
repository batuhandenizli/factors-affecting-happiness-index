# Factors Affecting Happiness Index

This project investigates the relationship between lifestyle habits, digital consumption, and psychological well-being. Using the **Mental Health and Social Media Balance Dataset**, the analysis focuses on identifying the key determinants that influence an individual's **Happiness Index**.

## 📊 Project Overview
The primary goal of this study is to analyze how daily screen time, sleep quality, physical activity, and social media usage patterns correlate with reported happiness levels. As a statistics student, this project demonstrates data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and data visualization techniques applied to real-world behavioral data.

## 💡 Key Insights from Analysis
Based on the statistical analysis of the dataset, the following trends were identified:

* **Sleep-Happiness Synergy:** A strong positive correlation was found; higher sleep quality scores (8+) are the most consistent predictors of high happiness levels.
* **The 6-Hour Threshold:** Happiness levels tend to decline significantly, and stress levels rise, when daily screen time exceeds a threshold of 6 hours.
* **The Exercise Buffer:** Weekly physical activity (3+ days) significantly mitigates the negative psychological impacts of high social media usage, acting as a mental health stabilizer.
* **Platform Variance:** Users primarily engaging with high-frequency scrolling platforms (e.g., TikTok, Instagram) report higher average stress levels compared to those using informative or professional platforms (e.g., LinkedIn, YouTube).

## 📁 Dataset Features
The analysis is based on a dataset containing the following variables:
- **Daily Screen Time (hrs):** Time spent on digital devices.
- **Sleep Quality (1-10):** Subjective rating of sleep restfulness.
- **Stress Level (1-10):** Reported psychological stress.
- **Exercise Frequency (days/week):** Physical activity levels.
- **Social Media Platform:** The primary platform used (Instagram, TikTok, LinkedIn, etc.).
- **Happiness Index (1-10):** The target variable representing overall well-being.
